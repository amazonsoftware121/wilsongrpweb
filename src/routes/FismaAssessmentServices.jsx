                                    FISMA stands for the Federal Information Security Management Act, which was passed by the United States Congress in 2002. FISMA was created to require each federal agency to develop, document, and implement a complete information security plan to protect and support the operations of the agency. FISMA compliance is data security guidance set by FISMA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

                                <Typography>FISMA compliance is mandatory for all federal agencies and any contractors or other organizations supporting a federal agency in IT system. That means not only federal agencies, but private sector companies that do business with federal agencies also must adhere to the same information security guidelines.</Typography>

                                Today's complex information systems and networks are enormously beneficial for most users, but they do come with certain inherent risks. Federal agencies are an alluring target for hackers because these agencies transmit, process, and store vital, strategic, and confidential information that could be used for personal gain or to harm national interests. Thatâ€™s why proper information security is so vital to a federal agency's ability to fend off cyber criminals and protect sensitive national security information.
