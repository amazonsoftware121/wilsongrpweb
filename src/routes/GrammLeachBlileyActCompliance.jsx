                                    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, is a United States federal law that mandates financial institutions to disclose information-sharing practices to their customers and proactively secure sensitive data. GLBA compliance prevents unauthorized sharing or loss of private customer data, which puts financial institutions at a lower risk of penalties or reputational damage.
