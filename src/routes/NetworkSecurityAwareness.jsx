                                    Securing sensitive information in cyberspace is essential to nearly every organizationsâ€™ operating procedure. The ability to understand, implement and maintain an effective security program is critical not only to protecting assets and operations, but it is also essential to the very survival of the organization itself. Security can only be effective if employees know and understand expectations and responsibilities.
