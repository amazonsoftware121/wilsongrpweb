                                    Vulnerability Assessment is the practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities within an organization’s network. This process is a key feature of several compliance, audit, and risk management frameworks. To minimize the window of opportunity for attackers, it is important to continuously assess and act on new information to identify vulnerabilities and remediate them.

                                    Numerous organizations across a wide swath of industries have recently reported a dramatic rise in intrusion attempts and cyberattacks. This trend has proven that organizations are under cyberattacks from both inside and outside their electronic perimeters, these intrusion attempts are wide-ranging and complex, and these attacks can result in serious financial losses.
