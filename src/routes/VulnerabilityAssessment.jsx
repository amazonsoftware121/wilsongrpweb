                                    Vulnerability Assessment is the practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities within an organization’s network. This process is a key feature of several compliance, audit, and risk management frameworks. To minimize the window of opportunity for attackers, it is important to continuously assess and act on new information to identify vulnerabilities and remediate them.
